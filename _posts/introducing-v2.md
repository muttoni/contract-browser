## Introduction

Composability is the backbone of web3 - a smart contract becomes a building block that others can extend, build on top of, and compound utility. That's why a tool that makes searching for, browsing, and working with smart contracts is an essential part of a composable ecosystem. 

Contract Browser 2.0 is built from the ground up, using state-of-the-art technologies and a new component framework. The result? A cleaner, more intuitive browsing experience that's easier to use than ever before, including on mobile.

## Search

The new cross-network search functionality makes it easy to find the smart contracts you need, whether you're looking on mainnet or testnet. Thanks to recently viewed contracts auto-suggested on search, you can instantly access your most frequently used contracts with just a few clicks.

## Onchain Functionality

With Contract Browser 2.0, you can connect your wallet and manage your account directly from our platform: deploy contracts via our user-friendly UI, as well as update an existing contract. 

When deploying a contract, you can enjoy automatic import detection and a new "Autofill" button to automagically fetch contract addresses based on the network you're deploying to – you'll never have to worry about making a mistake or waste time looking for the right address.

## Verified Contracts

Introducing Verified Contracts – import contracts with confidence. Verified contracts are "the right ones" to import, 100% of the time. Anyone can verify their contracts as verified, 100% for free filing a simply pull request. If you own popular contracts, [verify them here](). 

## Enhanced Browsing

Contracts can be complex, but are often made up of similar building blocks. With Snippets, you can more easily understand how each contract works. With deployment history you'll be able to see a contract's timeline. Thanks to smart caching you'll also enjoy snappier load times, you'll be able to browse more efficiently than ever before. 

## Roadmap

We – i.e. myself and Lanford, who built the backend service – are not done yet! In the coming months, we'll be working on even more features to enhance your experience with Contract Browser 2.0. Look out for enhanced interactivity, transaction suggestion, and FLIX and verified transaction support.
